We created our own implementation of the game “circle the dot”. This game is simple: a blue dot is trying to “escape” the board (that is, exit from the board), while the player attempts the prevent that by selecting grey dots, turning them into orange dots that the blue dot cannot cross. The player wins when the blue dot is encircled by orange dots. The initial location of the blue dot is randomly selected, but toward the centre of the board.

Developers Notes: 

- Two helper classes were created to improve readability. 
- The Queue (MQeu) class was implemented using a LinkedList and the bonus was implemented using it’s own class to prevent confusions and, again, increase readability.
